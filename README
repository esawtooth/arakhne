Arakhne

Arakhne is a graph based data retention layer built on top of Apache Cassandra.
I last worked on this a couple of years ago. It was last tested on Cassandra
version 0.7 and has not been updated since. It basically provides a
property graphy over the cassandra data model which very convieniently allows
for a simple adjacency list. I saw this while dusting my FS, and decided to
put it up here. It depends on the pycassa interface to cassandra.
